I will be making a short comedy in my CSS debut Yaay! Its 3 months since I wrote code on website design and just so you know I have been delving into some nursing research to earn myself an earnest living on this stony land <i>(shamba la mawe)</i>

There is this time I visit the hospital after having injured my foot. The doctor is a bit unfriendly and goes directly to asking what had taken me to hospital. Not long before I start talking, he rebukes me of not having greeted him on my entry to the <strong>DM</strong>,Doctor's room. Unbowed, I continue talking, "Naumwa na mguu".<br>
You know how medics talk as they are writing down as if telling me: You do the talking, as I write down. <br>
Doctor:Unaumwa na mguu. Okay. This is what we refer in medical terms as Foot and Mouth.<br>
Me:Na inauma sana.<br>
Doctor:Hautangoja sana.Mwenye alikuwa ameenda field kupeana AI (shorthand for Artificial Insemination) amerudi(he asks one of the staff passing by.<br>
Staff member:I have seen her car. She should be around.<br><br>
I walk away untreated.
